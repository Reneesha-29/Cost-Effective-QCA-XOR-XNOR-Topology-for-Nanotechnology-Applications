<p> Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is an ingenious nano level computer that implies less dimension, less power consumption, higher speed, and was designed as an augmentation to the scaling challenge with CMOS technology. To conduct logical processes, QCA technology uses arrays of quantum dots. Quantum dots are small particles that can trap electrons and holes and can be used to represent binary states. The logical state of the system is determined by the location of electrons and holes in the array in QCA. Nowadays, the massive growth in the number of transistors in a single chip, as well as the reduction in transistor size, is a critical problem for integrated circuit design and VLSI technology. The problem is that with this CMOS technology, transistor size reduction is restricted and nearly impossible beyond 10 nm since it might create anomalous quantum behaviors at the nanometric scale. </p>
